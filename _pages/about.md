I am a Robotics Research Engineer at <a href='https://ai.inventec.com/en/'>Inventec AI</a>, and advised by Dr. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&authuser=1&hl=en&user=aBzDmTQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&authuser=1'>Jeng-Lin Li</a> and Dr. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bndb0gYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Wei Chao Chen</a> (former supervisor). My work is focusing on qudruped robotics, with an emphsis on vision-language navigation, low-level control interface development, locomotion policy deployment, and sensor fusion.

I am currently applying for Fall 2026 M.S. programs in the US, with a focus on robotics and embodied intelligence.

Previously, I recieved my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University.</a>
