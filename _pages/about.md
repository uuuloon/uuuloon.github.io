I am a Robotics Research Engineer at <a href='https://ai.inventec.com/en/'>Inventec AI</a>, and advised by Dr. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&authuser=1&hl=en&user=aBzDmTQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&authuser=1'>Jeng-Lin Li</a> and Dr. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bndb0gYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Wei Chao Chen</a>. My work is focusing on qudruped robotics.

I'm currently working on Vision-Language Navigation. I've worked on the development of qudruped SDK, deployment of locomotion policies, and sensor fusion.

Previously, I recieved my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University.</a>
