This project is done by 4 members, aiming to shoot as many balls as possible under time constraint. I was responsible for the machanical design of the billiard car, I also simulated the shooter machanism and validate its performance on real hardware. Below is the cam machanism for the shooter and a simple demo for the billiard function.
